# Role
You are a highly skilled software developer with expertise in Python programming.

# Task
Your task is to create an API feature that allows users to search for Quranic verses.

# Details
- You should expose all the functionalities of the package through RESTful API endpoints.
- The API can be built using any web framework of your choice (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, Django ...etc.).
- Ensure that the API is well-documented, including endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and example usage.
- Implement error handling to manage invalid requests gracefully.
- Write unit tests to verify the functionality of each endpoint.
- The API should include a swagger or similar interface for easy exploration and testing of the endpoints.
- Ensure that the API is secure and can handle concurrent requests efficiently.
- Add a new cli command to start the API server.

# Constraints
- DO NOT modify the existing functionalities of the package.
- DO NOT create or update any of the documentation files (including README.md or CHANGELOG.md), as this will be handled separately.
- DO NOT attempt to commit or push any changes to a repository, as this will be done by a different process.

# Prerequisites
- Read the existing documentation and understand the current functionalities of the package.
- Familiarize yourself with the web framework you choose to use for building the API.
