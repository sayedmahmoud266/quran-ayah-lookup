## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- **⚡ 207x Faster Sliding Window**: Complete algorithm rewrite using alignment-based approach

  - New implementation using `rapidfuzz.fuzz.partial_ratio_alignment()` for iterative match finding
  - Character-to-word mapping with `bisect.bisect_right()` for O(log n) lookups
  - Iterative slicing from end of each match to find all occurrences
  - **Performance**: ~54ms per query (was ~11,150ms) = 207x improvement!
  - Maintains high accuracy: 97.1-100.0% similarity scores
  - Comprehensive algorithm documentation in `docs/implementation/ALIGNMENT_ALGORITHM_UPDATE.md`

- **💾 Performance Cache System**: Pre-computed corpus and word lists for optimal speed

  - New `__enable_cache__` flag in package initialization (default: `True`)
  - Pre-computed full corpus text (720,944 chars original, 405,394 normalized)
  - Pre-split word lists (82,459 original words, 77,881 normalized)
  - Pre-sorted reference lists (114 surahs, 6,348 ayah tuples)
  - Character-to-word offset mappings for O(log n) position lookups
  - **Performance**: ~28% speedup with cache enabled (54ms vs 69ms)
  - `finalize_cache()` method in `QuranDatabase` to build cache structures
  - Detailed cache documentation in `docs/implementation/PERFORMANCE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

- **📊 Basmalah-Aware Counting**: Precise verse counts with or without Basmalas

  - New `get_verse_count(include_basmalah: bool = False)` method in `QuranDatabase`
  - `total_verses_without_basmalah` attribute (6,236 verses)
  - Accurate distinction between total Quranic verses (6,236) and database entries (6,348)
  - Updated `get_all_verses()` to include Basmalas by default
  - Fixed test suite to account for Basmala counting

- **🎯 Absolute Indexing**: O(1) access to any verse by absolute position

  - Pre-sorted ayah reference list (6,348 tuples)
  - Enables sequential verse iteration
  - Foundation for future pagination and export features
  - Efficient batch operations across entire Quran

- **📚 Comprehensive Documentation**: Three new implementation documents
  - `docs/implementation/ALIGNMENT_ALGORITHM_UPDATE.md`: Complete algorithm rewrite details
  - `docs/implementation/PERFORMANCE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`: Cache system and basmalah features
  - `docs/implementation/SLIDING_WINDOW_CACHE_ANALYSIS.md`: Performance benchmarks and analysis
  - Updated README.md with new performance features and examples
  - Updated docs/index.md and docs/quickstart.md with performance sections

### Changed

- **Sliding Window Algorithm**: Complete rewrite from vectorized to alignment-based approach

  - Replaced `rapidfuzz.process.cdist()` with `fuzz.partial_ratio_alignment()`
  - Improved algorithm complexity from O(n\*m) to near-linear iterative approach
  - Better memory efficiency with incremental processing
  - More predictable performance characteristics

- **API Signature**: Updated `search_sliding_window()` to accept `db` parameter

  - Enables cache reuse across multiple searches
  - Maintains backward compatibility (db auto-loaded if not provided)
  - Better performance for batch search operations

- **Database Loading**: Enhanced initialization sequence
  - Cache finalization now occurs during `load_quran_db()` when cache is enabled
  - One-time cache build cost during database initialization
  - Subsequent searches benefit from pre-computed structures

### Performance

- **Sliding Window Search**: 207x faster (54ms vs 11,150ms per query)
- **Cache Impact**: 28% speedup when cache is enabled (54ms vs 69ms)
- **Accuracy**: Maintained high precision (97.1-100.0% similarity scores)
- **Memory**: Modest cache overhead (~2MB for corpus and word lists)

### Fixed

- **Test Suite**: Fixed `test_get_surah_chapter` to account for Basmala in verse counts
  - Updated expected count calculation: `len(surah) + (1 if surah.has_basmala() else 0)`
  - All 152 tests now passing

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-17
